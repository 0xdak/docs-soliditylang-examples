# Solidity Examples by provided SolidityLang docs

Here, there is a collection of contracts written in Solidity language provided in the Solidity docs itself.

For more, please check the latest documents from [Solidity site](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/)

Note: The contracts are not the original ones from docs. I will be developing the code, running tests and diversifying scenarios as part of my learning process.
